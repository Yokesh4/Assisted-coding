# üßÆ Binary Set Bit Counter

## üìù Problem Statement
You are developing a utility for analyzing the **number of set bits** (`1`s) in the binary representation of various numeric types in Java. This tool helps developers and testers evaluate the bit-level structure of values across types like `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`.

You need to create a function that counts how many bits are set (`1`) in the **64-bit binary representation** of a given `long` value.

---

## üîç Task

Implement a method that:
1. Accepts a **`long` number** as input.
2. Treats the number as a **64-bit two's complement binary**.
3. Counts and prints the number of `1`s (set bits) in the binary form.
4. Shifts bits **unsigned** (`>>>`) to ensure all 64 bits are evaluated (even for negative numbers).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Method Signature

```java
public static void countBit(long num)
```

> Output Format:
```
Set bit count: <count>
```

---

## üü° Special Conditions

- Negative numbers are stored in **two's complement** form in Java.
- Use the **unsigned right shift operator (`>>>`)** to avoid infinite loops with negative numbers.
- Java treats all smaller types (`byte`, `short`, `int`) as `int`, so you must handle promotion to `long` properly when analyzing bits.
