## 🧠 Solution Approach (Algorithm)

To count all zeros in the string, you can follow this approach:

1. Initialize a counter `count` to `0`.
2. Traverse each character of the string.
3. For each character, if it is `'0'`, increment the `count`.
4. Return the final count after traversing the string.

5. ## 📝 Pseudocode

```pseudo

FUNCTION zeroCounting(num):
    SET count = 0  // Initialize the count to 0
    
    FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(num) - 1:
        SET digit = num[i]  // Get the current character
        
        IF digit == '0':
            INCREMENT count  // Increment count if the digit is '0'
    
    RETURN count  // Return the total count of '0' digits
```

💡 Complexity Analysis

| Metric           | Value                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Time Complexity  | O(N), where N = length of the string |
| Space Complexity | O(1), constant extra space used      |
